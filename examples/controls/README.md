These examples were ported from [qtquickcontrols](git@gitorious.org:qt/qtquickcontrols.git).

Only the basic ones were ported, in order to demonstrate how easy it is to create a full-fledged UI with Go and QML.

There were a few more, but they that had native modules and those were omitted due to laziness.

In order to run them you might need some extra Qt5 plugins. On Ubuntu those can be installed using this command:
    sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-controls-plugin qtdeclarative5-xmllistmodel-plugin
